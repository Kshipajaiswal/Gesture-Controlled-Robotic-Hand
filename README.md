# Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Hand
This project presents a low-cost, Arduino-based robotic hand that replicates human hand movements using flex sensors. The hand mimics finger gestures in real-time using servo motors and serves as a basis for prosthetic applications, remote control systems, and educational robotics.
